# Game-Blue
In this challenge you will download, install and run a gamification server with embedded Node-RED that will aid you in learning and familiarizing with Node-RED.

## Installation :zap:
To install the game server, you need to be running Docker in your `local machine`. You can then execute the following command:
```console
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 captainflin/game-blue:alpha
```

## Playing
Once you have started the docker container, go ahead and open `http://localhost:3000` to access the game.

Enjoy the storylines and have fun!
